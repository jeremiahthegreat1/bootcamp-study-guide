        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. 
            Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, 
            search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely 
            important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. 
            We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas.</li>
          <li>A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>
          <li>Class selectors can be used when you do not want to apply a style to all elements of a specific type.</li>
          <li>The style.css file must be linked in the head element in order for the style to display as intended.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Git</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>gits status: cd that checks what branch we are currently working on</li>
      <li>git checkout -b branch-name: cd that creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

          <ul>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language</li>
            <li>When an array with multiple values exists, it would pull back all data items unless we identify the items using the index, a unique number that describes the location of the individual data.  These would be zero-indexed or start with zero and sequential.</li>
            <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.  Arrays can hold strings, numbers, and other types of data.</li>
            <li>Control flow can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
            <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
