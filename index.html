          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. 
            Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, 
            search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely 
            important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. 
            We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas.</li>
          <li>A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>
          <li>Class selectors can be used when you do not want to apply a style to all elements of a specific type.</li>
          <li>The style.css file must be linked in the head element in order for the style to display as intended.</li>
