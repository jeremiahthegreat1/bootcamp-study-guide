## Description

For this project I was motivated to hit the ground running with a tool that will allow me to easily compile and reference notes from web development bootcamp.  I built this as I prefer technology use over pen and paper notes, especially when the work or end product can only truly be completed using technology.  This will prevent the need for paper notes and will allow others to benefit from my notes as well.  I learned the basics on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as guidelines for a respectable README file.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This guide can be used by navigating each section's notes and finding the topic in question, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  If the console is opened using DevTools you may also view the JavaScript running.  The JavaScript will randomly select a topic from the pre-work to study first on your behalf.
